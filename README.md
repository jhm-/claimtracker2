Immediate goals: cleanup, better exception handling, Claimtable.update() method external use to application; unit tests

Proximate goal: compaction is not working!, add email functionality

Subsequent: add functions to the top bar (rename, update, import, settings), and can we get the iframe working?
(nb. if the iframe works, replace ClaimTable.sheet1.url with ClaimTable.address with the parameter 'rm=minimal' appended)
