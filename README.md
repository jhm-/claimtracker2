Immediate goals: fix 'new' function to handle exceptions/defaults, needs a dialog to set the name (rename method);
'delete' function to delete/destroy tables; clean-up properly on Ctrl-C; list on index not working (selected table)

Refactor: cleanup, better exception handling, Claimtable.update() method external use to application; unit tests;
docstrings

Proximate goal: add email functionality

Subsequent: sidebar on Flask application (rename, update, import, settings), and can we get the iframe working?
